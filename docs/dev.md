## Characters

Our game characters are drawn by hand, most of them taking inspiration from cartoons that we used to watch when we were kids. For example, our main character (a college student) is a combination of Ferb from Phineas and Ferb and our teammate, Edi. 
The characters are similar to the originals (from cartoons like Phineas and Ferb, Courage the cowardly dog etc.), but they are redesigned in order to fit our aesthetic.
